Build environment:

        gcc option, treat warnings as errors

        add Z9001 as target
        use compiler defines __Z1013__,__Z9001__,__KC85__ for each target

        OPTION_SHOW_HEXDUMP=OFF in the MAKEFILE omits the terminal output of the hex dump after build

        add initial version of KRT 11 graphics library for Z1013 and Z9001
           support simple font handling, output strings and characters
           two fonts included: Z1013(no Umlauts) and ModernComputer(plus Umlauts) 

        must declare all externals in the assembly source code        
        (remove -#-g all unresolved symbols are external)

Some ideas for optimizations, resp develop on 8-bit systems:

        using global variables is not always the best choice - using a local variable may help the compiler to 
        optimize it in a register - but again, if the variable cannot be kept in a register and has to be copied
        from stack that advantage may be lost - reducing the scope { int local= global; } may help

        __z88dk_callee - avoid stack correction after return
        krt_putchar function header 131 cycles to prepare the registers
        56 to correct the stackpointer

        in general callee may take care to clean up the stack
           
        add docu   limited   printf("  initialized string str:%s\n", str);
        printf("  initialized word    w2:0x%04x\n", w2);
        printf("  initialized word    w3:0x%04x\n", w3);
        printf("  initialized char    c1:%c\n", c1);
        printf("  initialized char    c2:%c\n", c2);
        printf("uninitialized word    w1:0x%04x\n", w1);
